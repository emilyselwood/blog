# Hello World

I'm Wil Selwood. Every so often I get the urge to try and start a blog again. Here is iteration 235.

## What do I do?

I build systems for a living. Mostly data processing but I'll happily get my hands dirty doing anything that needs to get done. I've worked many things from Unity and C# to C, Groovy, Go, Javascript, and Big data things like Accumulo and Spark. 

## What will be here?

I am planning to have posts about technical topics. I have ideas for the first couple. They may take me a while to build. Due to my love of space many of the examples will use space data sets. I'll try to keep every thing free to use.
