I am a software engineer. Currently work at the Satellite Applications Catapult in Harwell, Oxfordshire. It is a great place to work. I get to be involved in some really interesting projects that help make the work a better place. Unfortunately not all of them I can talk about.

I work with a wide range of tools. Mostly with a geographical or space side. Programming language wise I'm always happy to learn new things. This has meant that I've worked with a lot of languages over the years (See below). I've done things from big data with Apache Accumulo, Cassandra, Geomesa, Spark and Hadoop to front end things with Javascript and the Unity games engine.

## Language List

* Go
* Scala
* Java
* Python
* Javascript
* C#
* C
* C++
* Groovy
* Bash

Old stuff I've not touched in a very long time

* PHP
* Delphi
* Pascal
* Ruby

I've had a play with a lot of other languages but wouldn't really say I know them
